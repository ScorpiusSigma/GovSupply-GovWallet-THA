## Background

'Tis the season of giving, and you have the important task of distributing gifts to department teams. Each team can send a representative to redeem their gifts at the counter. The representative must show their staff pass as proof of identity, and each staff pass has a unique ID. A CSV file contains the mapping of staff pass IDs to their corresponding team names, along with the timestamp of when the mapping record was added.

## Task

Build a system that supports three main functions:

1. **Look up:** Perform a lookup of the representative's staff pass ID against the mapping file.
2. **Verify:** Verify if the team can redeem their gift by comparing the team name against past redemptions in the redemption data.
3. **Add Redemption:** Add new redemption to the redemption data if the team is still eligible; otherwise, send the representative away.

The redemption data should include at least the following information: `team_name` and `redeemed_at`, where the latter refers to the timestamp the redemption occurred in epoch milliseconds.
